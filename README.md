Data Set present in the Data directory. However, the data in the notebook was uploaded using google drive (as the project was originally completed using Google Colab).

Jupyter notebook is present in the Code directory and the data set is present in the Data directory.

Jupyter Notebook Contents:

1.(a) Loading the Data Set, Data Exploration and Pre-processing, One-Hot Encoding the dependent features

1.(b) Transfer Learning

i.  VGG-16 Base Model

ii. VGG-16 implementation without Image augmenatation

iii. VGG-16 implementation with Image augmenatation

iv. EfficientNetB0 Base model

v. EfficientNetB0 implementation without Image augmenatation

vi. EfficientNetB0 implementation with Image augmenatation
